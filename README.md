# Cloud_Project
Created a REST API with authentication, authorization, pagination, status codes, and proper resource-based URLs. The application uses HTTP verbs (POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE) to store two kinds of non-user entities (Boats and Loads) and one kind of user entity (Users) in Datastore. A boat is owned by a user. A user can own multiple boats. A boat can have zero, one, or more loads on it. A load can only be assigned to one boat. The user is shown a welcome page where they will be redirected to log in or create a new user account with a Google account, and permission to access their profile will be requested. After the user has given consent to the application to get their data from Google, it will show their JWT and display/create their user ID for this application. A Postman collection is also created, which tests the API successfully.
